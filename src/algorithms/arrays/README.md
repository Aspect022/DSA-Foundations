# 📌 Arrays - Complete Guide

Arrays are one of the most basic and commonly used data structures. They are a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.

## 📖 Topics to Cover

### 🧱 1. Basics
- What is an array?
- Memory layout & indexing
- Static vs Dynamic Arrays
- One-dimensional vs Two-dimensional arrays

### 🔨 2. Basic Operations
- Traversal (for/while loop)
- Insertion at:
    - Beginning
    - End
    - Specific index
- Deletion from:
    - Beginning
    - End
    - Specific index
- Updating elements

### 🔍 3. Searching
- Linear Search
- Binary Search (Iterative & Recursive)
- Upper Bound / Lower Bound (via Binary Search)
- Search in Rotated Sorted Array

### 🧹 4. Sorting
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Counting Sort
- In-built sorting (e.g. `Arrays.sort()` in Java)

### 💡 5. Array Techniques & Patterns
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Prefix Sum
- Difference Array
- Binary Search on Answer
- Frequency Map (using HashMap)
- Kadane’s Algorithm (Maximum Subarray)
- Dutch National Flag Algorithm (3-way partitioning)
- Moore’s Voting Algorithm
- Sieve of Eratosthenes (for primes)
