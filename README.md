# 🧠 DSA Reset — Java Practice Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) reset journey in Java! 🚀  
This repository is a structured, topic-wise collection of DSA implementations that cover the most essential concepts and techniques, written from scratch in Java.

## 📌 Why This Repo?

After diving deep into AIML theory (and feeling slightly overwhelmed 😅), I wanted to reset my fundamentals and rebuild my muscle memory for DSA from the ground up — the **clean way**.

This repo is for:
- Practicing and mastering **core DSA concepts**
- Writing clean, modular, and optimized **Java code**
- Building a solid **reference base** for interviews and competitive coding
